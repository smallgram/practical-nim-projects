# Practical Nim Projects

This is a Nim implementation of the projects contained in the [Practical Python Projects](https://practicalpython.yasoob.me) book by [Yasoob Khalid](https://yasoob.me). I like the projects in this book and wanted to see how easily I could implement each of them in Nim. This is just a learning project, and does not have much practical use as-is.

Each project is contained in a separate sub-folder. The top-level only contains configuration-type files that apply to every project (or the repository as a whole).

You can probably run each project by running `nimble run` in each project's directory.
